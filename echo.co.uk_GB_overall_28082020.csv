To look out for your safety and to ensure medicine is only ordered when needed, we are unable to dispense medication without it being prescribed by your GP. There are also regulations we must abide by where we cannot dispense medication to a patient without a prescription. Please contact us in-app for more clarity if needed.

Sorry to hear you are not happy with our service. We urge all patients to request medication 7-10 days before they run out to allow time to receive your prescription from the surgery, dispense & dispatch. Your medication was out of stock from the supplier causing the delay, we sent you notifications about this. Apologies once again.

I've been unable to collect my medications lately. You ask Echo what you need, they request them from your GP, Echo gets an electronic prescription and their pharmacist prepare your order. It's then sent out via Royal nail 24/48hr delivery usually. Some item's will need a signature when delivered. It can take up to 5-6 day's for your GP to respond. So be aware of this.

Because of the hours I work, it was difficult for me to get to the pharmacy and also the prescription request system at my GP is a joke. By using Echo, it's now entirely automated - I press a button, and a few days later the tablets arrive. Yes you do have to think on and order a couple of days before you run out, but you should be doing that anyway, right? Only downside is that I recommended it to a friend but her medication isn't available as it's restricted - not the fault of Echo but a shame for her.

Would not recommend it. They don't appear to work on weekends and on top of this they use Royal Mail 2nd class to post, meaning a potential 3 to 4 day delay before you get your medication. A 4 day delay between leaving the Dr and starting treatment can mean you get worse. My local pharmacy is open 7 days a week from 7am to 11pm, I can get my prescriptions sent to them electronically and collect immediately after leaving the GP. Sorry but this is not a good idea unfortunately.",1,17,2.24.4,2019-04-13 18:16:59,"Hi Pete, 
Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review. Getting medication can take 5-10 days, depending on your GP. Our process involves getting the prescription, doing several checks in our pharmacy and putting it in the post. We send all packages with Royal Mail using their 24-hour or 48-hour delivery service.
Hope this helps!

The emails they send contain your full personal details -so in direct violation of Data Protection! Don't ever use them! stick to your local pharmacy as they ALL offer an ordering service for you,1,6,2.24.3,2019-02-25 19:11:34,"Hi Bek,

They couldn't get my medication to me in time even though I ordered two weeks in advance. Six days to request it from my surgery, six days to process, didn't even get as far as posting it to me which would have taken another five working days to reach me. No number to call if something goes wrong, useless customer service via a message service that take too long to respond (with auto-populated messages). Realising I wouldn't get my order in time, i messaged Echo who offered a barcode which was supposed to allow me to collect it from a pharmacy as an emergency. When I tried to do this, I was told by two different pharmacies that the code was redundant. I contacted Echo again who sent me the same code, which again was redundant. Had to arrange an emergency prescription (in tears) through my surgery directly. They've never heard of this company and have advised me not to use Echo again. Ironically, without my medication I'm at high risk of a heart attack: take away the medication and add the stress of trying to obtain the medication via Echo = a life-threatening situation.

explain to the GP why I need so much medication. I did not authorise this

strongly advise against using this app. Update 9th August. GP contacted me 
again saying that the app had again requested medication without my 
consent. This is ridiculous. There is no way to cancel this request in the 
app because I did not ask for it. My GP is now very annoyed with me because 
of the time wasting, and has asked me to go in for a medication review

It is approaching the second week and now I'm being informed that they are awaiting to be stocked even though the day before I was told that it was ready and waiting for dispatch. I understand that we should order medication in plenty of time but I have purchased a 'pre-pay certificate' limited to 3 months to cover me through the hayfever season so the time is limited to make sure I'm stocked up for the season. I can not put in orders too early as my GP surgery do not release prescriptions too early due to assuming I have enough medication. It was far far easier to go on my GP's website, order my meds, pick up after 48 hours then order my prescription from the supermarket pharmacy that is just round the corner. I thought this the app was to save me the time and the hassle but it seems to cause me more headache. Surely, with the technology, this should be far easier?

Unfortunately the app didn't give me an estimate of how long it would take until I ordered my first lot of meds. Unfortunately I can't get to my GP because I work during open hours so I figured, I'll go a week without my meds. Annoying but what can I do?  The app sends me a notification saying my GP has approved my request. THIS WAS A LIE. So I sat waiting for a couple of weeks and today, after being 2 weeks off of my meds, I opened the app to message saying the GP surgery I selected has told ECHO that I'm not a patient there. So now my best chance of getting my medication is to wait until Wednesday when my mother is off work and have her put in for a repeat then leave work 3 hours early (which will be unpaid) and get a taxi (which will cost £30) so I can be back in time to pick it up before surgery closes.
