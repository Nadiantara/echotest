6287477022,Zunders321,4.30.0,1,Dreadful service!!,"The app failed to update the progress of my prescription. Although my GP had issued the prescription first thing Monday morning, Echo maintained they were still waiting for my GP to forward it on Wednesday afternoon. I contacted Echo through the app & was again told the problem lay with my GP. I contacted my surgery again, they provided a reference number to prove it had been sent at 9am on Monday. I managed to speak to someone at Echo by telephone Thursday morning, they admitted the error was due to a technical difficulty they were having. They said they would release the prescription so that I could pick it up at a local pharmacy. The pharmacist attempted to issue the prescription but was unable to as it was still held by Echo. Several calls hi Echo & my GP (by the lovely pharmacist & myself) & still no resolution. Echo has admitted the problem is entirely their fault but that doesn‚Äôt help when my medication is now going to run out. Hopefully my GP be able to reissue another prescription tomorrow afternoon. So it‚Äôll be another day way for medication that should have been delivered quickly by post."

How confusing for a Senior first time user of the App. Yesterday I received a message to say the Meds were out of stock until 11th August... quite which message is correct I have yet to discover! Perhaps the second time of use the App will be clearer, fingers X‚Äôd."

They have a service to contact them optimistically called ‚Äòchat‚Äô but actually you send a message and get a reply the next day. Unless it‚Äôs the weekend obviously. No updates on what‚Äôs going on, no information on when I can expect to get it. Nothing. Several other drugs out of stock as well though I think that‚Äôs a national thing though they have given no indication of this. If you have important medicines stay well away. I‚Äôd say the risk of going to the pharmacy and catching COVID 19 is far less scary to me than the devastation caused by signing up to this service. Now have to work out how to get out."
6264555862,MonsterMol,4.23.2,3,Nearly Perfect,This app would have received 5 stars were it not for the fact it randomly cancelled my repeat prescription and won‚Äôt let me reorder it. I‚Äôve being trying all day. I wanted to speak with someone regarding this but had to use the ‚Äú Contact a support team‚Äù. I first left the message on there 7 hours ago and it‚Äôs still not been looked at. I work in customer service and if I left my customers that long I would be fired. So I‚Äôm reduced to writing on here. If I‚Äôm honest I‚Äôm not holding out much hope of this either being read or acted upon. I just want my to reorder my medication as the app keeps telling to.

6258987043,Hetty Boom Ting,4.23.2,5,Cannot fault üòÅ,"Was casually playing a game, it had an ad for ‚ÄòEcho‚Äô, it was an instant reminder that I needed to order a prescription (thank you üôÇ). 
I installed the app.  Registered with my personal details and medications which was quick and painless.  It only took roughly 24 hours for the prescription to be verified by my surgery.
I was notified that my prescription request had been verified by the pharmacy and that payment was required.  Once again, the process was quick and painless.
Within about an hour I was notified that my prescription had been checked and was being dispatched, they sent me a tracking number also.
This method of ordering my repeat prescriptions will save me miles in journeys, will save me lots of time queuing at the already busy pharmacy, and will save the pharmacy staff from having to serve me.  It will avoid close proximity to others during this Covid crisis.  Would totally recommend this service.
The App is very easy to use, and I find it very reassuring that the user is able to check on the progress of their prescription request at any time.
Top marks guys, very pleased with the App and the service overall üòÅ"

6210041505,kezzawd,4.23.2,3,A big BUT for notifications,"Love the service as the app works great with one very key exception - dose reminders. 

These really need to be persistent and display a badge per med until such time as taking the dose has been achieved. This for me is a very important feature of a reminder notification - any opportunity to simply swipe it away, banishing it to the darkest recesses of my phone, is only meeting half the requirement in my book. Be great if the developers could sort ?"

I went to my local pharmacy to collect the meds but as I order had gone to echo and the prescription takes three days to get to me.
My doctor‚Äôs surgery said it‚Äôs not possible for me to use both echo for my monthly meds and use a local pharmacy for emergency antibiotics- I have to choose, one or the other.

So alas I will have to cancel my account with echo in case I ever need an emergency prescription again (it took me a couple of hours of phone calls and waiting in my local pharmacy to resolve).

I did email echo customer services but they didn‚Äôt seem to have a solution in case it happens again."

As soon as you‚Äôve set your account up with echo initially (very straightforward) it‚Äôs then just a question of ordering your medication, pay on the same app and wait for your medication to arrive in the post.

Thing is and only a minor thing and thats when I confirmed my order it malfunctioned and when I returned I couldn‚Äôt redo it but thing was it was a case of did it go thru or not and when another email came thru asking me to order again it had already been done 

The response team also needs to respond a bit quicker as waiting for an answer was feeling like an eternity and as my meds  had already changed status 30 minutes before the team responded i felt like there was a bit of a lack of response from helping 

Will still use the service but just minor improvements needed

It was only when the COVID-19 pandemic occurred and after receiving the letter advising I should shield that I thought I should really sign up to this service. I am SO glad I did, and can‚Äôt believe I didn‚Äôt sooner. Ordering my prescription literally takes seconds, and in only a couple of clicks on the Echo app. If you have a Medical Exemption Certificate you can link it to your account, or it provides you with the ability to pay via the app if you do not have the Exemption Certificate.
The app tells you when you are able to request your next prescription, tells you the next steps of what will happen with your request, and then provides a tracking number for the delivery.

6107654684,Richard lockdown,4.21.0,5,Phone service,I was helped by Kunar who managed to overcome my problems with login during a long phone call. He was very patient and sorted it out. The problem must have been my use of the password reset option.  It is hard to understand that I failed to reset the password five times. But with his help I registered a new password in one try and ordered my pills. It was a brilliant outcome. Thanks very much Kunar.

Not a seemless experience, I have to monitor regularly to see if I should order for anyone. Items have finally arrived (slight delay with issuing or delivery each time so allow a 7 day cushion) and as something of a ‚Äòcontrol freak‚Äô having to still monitor/control is ok, but definitely not an autonomous system.
Most annoying, once meds have arrived for the first time I receive a notification for everyone to take their medication throughout each day. My father alone takes 14 pills a day, so this is becoming annoying to say the least. Is there a way to turn that off?? Haven‚Äôt found it yet! Will persevere with it as easier to control than anything else I‚Äôve tried so far and stops the need to queue at a pharmacy during this lockdown period."

But, I now have a ‚Äòrepeat dispensing prescription‚Äô and this app doesn‚Äôt work with these. 
You have to leave a ‚Äòchat‚Äô message through the app when you need your meds, however this hasn‚Äôt worked (keeps telling me to raise a prescription, which you don‚Äôt need to). You can call Echo (once you‚Äôve found their telephone number) and wait 30 mins to talk to someone who gives you conflicting advice (leave a chat message or ask your Surgery for a prescription). Please note: at 37 mins the call is disconnected!
Yes this service is great and convenient to have meds posted to you, but getting help and matters sorted is not easy, you do all the leg work by timing around."

It‚Äôs really difficult once you are in this loop, deciding what the quickest way of obtaining your meds is ..... especially if you are reliant upon them   .... Echo doesn‚Äôt seem to have any mechanism to advise on tablet availability , the staff on the chat are very polite and helpful .... but can‚Äôt advise on delivery ....

The only issue I have is with the medication reminders. Some of my medication doesn‚Äôt appear as a daily reminder, so I‚Äôve used an external app to track my dosing and when. Would be 5 stars if you could personalise the reminders within the app more, e.g. add or remove anything you‚Äôve previously been prescribed, set them up whenever you need to, full control over how often you need to take your medication, etc."

Last few months have been stressful using this company and app. Medication being delivered at last minute right before running out, even though ordered at least 2 weeks before running out. (Because I don‚Äôt like leaving myself short of medication) 
Customer service is a joke, they repeat the same thing to you over and over again and are not helpful.

Unfortunately my experience was not good. I requested my prescription when the app notified me it was due. I got notification to say my medicine was out of stock, so I contacted customer service, and they advised they would have stock shortly and then it would take 2-3 working days to arrive (incl Saturday as a working day). This meant that potentially my medicine would arrive just on time. 

Today I took my last pill and the medication still hasn‚Äôt arrived. I‚Äôve emailed them to ask for a refund and to send my prescription back to the database so I can request it from my GP and so far no reply.

5286428709,Ewanof,4.10.0,1,"Good app, useless pharmacy, avoid!","The app is great and when the service works (see other users‚Äô glowing reviews) it‚Äôs great and saves loads of time. I used echo myself for a few months (simple repeat prescription of one item) and also for my partner (more complicated prescription of five or six items, all widely used generic drugs though). 

Unfortunately if there‚Äôs any problem with your prescription things rapidly go off the rails... you can‚Äôt tell if there‚Äôs a problem from the app (your request just sits there for days with no update), Echo won‚Äôt contact you to tell you until you chase them, they won‚Äôt do anything to help, they take a day to reply to their email (office hours only), they don‚Äôt answer the phone at all, eventually when they do reply they just say ‚Äúspeak to your GP‚Äù as the answer to each and every issue, and before you know it you‚Äôve spent a week going round in circles and you still don‚Äôt have your prescription. 

Avoid at all costs!"
5283776183,Heathfran56,4.10.0,5,Best service,"I‚Äôm so glad I joined Echo because it‚Äôs delivered no cost and every time I am due to take my medication they send a reminder  4 times a day everyday.

They couldn‚Äôt do anything more to make your experience any easier or to help! If you had a problem with medication or an issue with the prescription they would be able to help but unfortunately that has changed! I started using it again as I remember it being really really easy but OMG it has been hassle, after hassle, after hassle with delays for delivery‚Äôs, script turn arounds, me chasing the GP and finding that it‚Äôs not theirs fault it‚Äôs echos, loosing information etc! 

They need to make some changes ASAP and get it back to what it used to be like because it‚Äôs changed and not for the better unfortunately!"

5235660757,Gazbertrum,4.10.0,5,What an excellent service,"I am really impressed with this service/app. You get a reminder 10 days before your medication runs out and then you get delivery status and delivery is usually within 2 days - couldn't be easier. I used to have to drive to the pharmacy, which was across town, so this free service saves me both time and money - first class - I can't recommend Echo highly enough."

5222052106,Elmmire,4.9.0,5,Echo,"Fantastic app and so much easier than having to go to my doctors to request a repeat prescription to then wait for it to go to the pharmacy.
I‚Äôve forgotten about my prescriptions a couple of times and it‚Äôs been a huge cause of frustration and stress. 

This way is perfect but it‚Äôs annoying that they can‚Äôt post it through my letter box which then means I have to go to the post office which is closed by the time I‚Äôm finished work!
Is there any way that they can leave it somewhere else or if I could give them an alternate address?"
5219875562,deliriouswombat,4.9.0,3,Slow dispatch and delivery,"Sent prescriptions take 2 days or more to arrive, since they use Royal Mail 48 service and they don‚Äôt dispatch on Saturdays or Sundays. Sometimes you have to wait even longer: if they are out of stock, they will hold your whole parcel with multiple prescriptions just because of one medication being out of stock. They could offer to automatically release medications if they are out of stock but would only do so if you get in touch with their support team (who are not available after hours). This is a brilliant service but definitely not for those who need an immediate access to their medications."
5218393102,Matt2962,4.9.0,2,"Always out of stock, poor communication","I have been using echo for a long time now and generally never had a problem, however each order for the last 4 times has not been in stock. Each time this happens you get one email and that‚Äôs it, no further update, nothing in the app, no option in the app to release it, or assign to another pharmacy, no indicator of stock on ordering, no proactive communication, no further updates, nothing.
When we are talking about daily critical medication and people with busy lifestyles personally I don‚Äôt think this is acceptable and they should do better. After 4 failed orders in a row for 4 months, I will not be using this app again. Time to find an alternative.
Undoubtably the response to this will probably be ‚Äúwe can release the order to you so that you can get it from a pharmacy of your choice‚Äù. That response is completely missing the point of what users want and need from this app."
5209599337,fi@1013,4.9.0,5,Brilliant service...,"Can‚Äôt fault the service, Echo prompt me when I am due and then they request an electronic prescription from my gp and the next I know my meds are delivered through my door. Definitely makes me more compliant at taking my meds now."
5196052873,TopDMC,4.9.0,1,So many things that aren‚Äôt right,"Where to start, you place an order and get confirmation. You get an email confirming dispatch. That‚Äôs about the best it gets - no way of knowing what‚Äôs been dispatched so the only time you know is when the box arrives with items missing. You need to speak to someone, but no telephone number and when you do find a telephone number by going through Lloyd‚Äôs Pharmacy, it tells you to send an email. They must have many issues, as waited 24 hours and still no response. Some of the medication for my mother is important and she must not run out, so you can imagine how frustrated I got. Then finally got through to a person who informed me that the balance of the order was posted in a separate box 2 days later and should hopefully be delivered within 48 hours. Still no way of seeing this through the website or on the App."

I reinstalled a few days ago and tried to log in to my account but failed. I tried to register again but the app advises that I already have an account. I tried to reset my password but no email was received. 

I‚Äôm now 72 hours into their awful tech/customer support through social media and I‚Äôm told my account has been deleted (app says otherwise) but I can‚Äôt log in, reset password or re-register. 

Absolutely useless! Try one of the other apps (which come with customer service)!"

5131677027,granttiller,4.7.0,1,Started well,"I have been using Echo for over a year now.
They started off well - superb response times, fast turnaround and excellent customer service.

However, as they have grown in size, their response time has got worse, and customer service is becoming less personable.

The last major app redesign felt like a step backwards, the user interface is much less engaging and definitely less intuitive.

Also they have changed the charging now - your card is debited as soon as you place the order, whether the item is in stock or not. If there is an issue, they then have to process a refund.

Frustrated, I have just signed up with Pharmacy2U and am finding it much easier to use.

Such a shame."
5123303989,andriy96,4.7.0,3,Notifications Bug,"I specifically have dose reminder notifications turned off, yet the app still does the notifications. What‚Äôs the point of giving the option if it‚Äôs not going to work?"

5110020059,SindyBiz,4.6.1,2,Great App - but the back office systems not so,"I used this service once, for one prescription. It was a disaster. In simple terms the electronic transfer of prescription from my GP to Echo worked perfectly. Associating that prescription with me, didn‚Äôt. In the end I had to get the prescription transferred back to me and get it dispensed the old fashioned way. The pharmacy who dispensed it were great. So as a result they will get my business going forward. I complained to Echo and they investigated, but their explanation still left me with concerns about their handling of my data."
5109743454,nidgysmum,4.6.1,5,Stress-free,"Started using this app a few months ago. The app itself was easy to set-up (done in minutes) although my GP surgery & local Lloyd‚Äôs Pharmacy didn‚Äôt have any recollection of it, I reluctantly put my first request through having had a quick response to my message to Customer Services. To my surprise, it arrived within a matter of days! I‚Äôve had all my prescriptions from them ever since & with no trouble at all. The app itself is easy to navigate and sends reminders of when you‚Äôre low on meds, you get a clear history of your orders (which is great to keep track of meds if switching from one to another) and is easy access to your NHS Number which is handy when asking for it whilst calling the hospital, etc. It‚Äôs made my life so much easier, not having to go to the GP surgery to request repeats (usually missing deadlines) and pick them up at a later date from the pharmacy (normally waiting around in queues). I means I can actually get on with my life without worrying. I order a lot of meds so thought I might have to wait in for the postman but even on bulk orders, it comes in letterbox friendly recyclable packaging so I can come and go as I please. This really is a great service which I hope will remain this way!"

5061019936,Nothing but noodles,4.5.0,1,Don‚Äôt expect help or Solutions,"I contacted them because I noticed my medication hadn‚Äôt been delivered. Their response was just ‚ÄúRoyal Mail has marked it as delivered‚Äù no solutions no support just ‚Äúnot our problem‚Äù its in their terms and conditions that they will do this, take your money but not give support.
Turns out they‚Äôd sent it to the wrong address, I‚Äôd already contacted them to make sure they wouldn‚Äôt send it to the wrong address and they assured me it wouldn‚Äôt, well clearly they did. I used this to make my life easier when moving house but it seems like they actually made my life harder.

Thank you for just telling me over and over it‚Äôs not your fault and that there is no solution other than you taking my money and saying there is nothing you can do about it.
Also my order of the pill, I usually get a years worth from my pharmacist but these guys only sent me a months worth only. I won‚Äôt be using this service again, that‚Äôs for sure."

Can‚Äôt seem to find a way of setting my account up so that it reminds me to go for a check up every 5 mths and then reminds me to request my meds.

4551810201,BRE3NY,3.18.2,5,Echo,"I‚Äôm not really a serial reviewer. I felt the need to put a positive review on this service for how quick and simple it has made getting my medication without any fuss. I normally have to go the doctors to put my repeat prescription in by hand, then return the next day to collect my prescription and take it to the chemist. It was a lot of messing around trying to fit it in around a working day and collecting the kids. Now thanks to Echo, I simply click on the reminder, its time to order and I have my medication through the door a couple of days later. Amazing service for the busy individual who has to juggle there time. Thanks."
4551552895,cathmate,3.18.2,5,So easy,Love this service/app been using it for over a year. Staff have been very friendly on the few occasions I‚Äôve needed them. I have recommended this to family and friends. Well done.

4538295206,lillyb811,3.18.2,1,Medical emergency,Cancelled my prescription after making me wait 7 days when I ordered it 10 days before I ran out they say the supplier is out of stock so now I have 3 days of meds and if my local pharmacy has nothing I will have to go to my local walk in centre as I am an epileptic
4537883915,Player12345678901234567890,3.18.2,5,Everyone should use this app for their repeat prescriptions!,Such an efficient and useful app. Makes the process of ordering and receiving repeat prescriptions SO easy! Thank you!
4536314072,yateley37,3.18.2,5,"Never written a review before, but more than happy to do so now.","I was dubious about using this app, but I have to say it really is a wonderful service.
It takes the worry out of going to the doctors surgery just to re-order repeat prescriptions, then going to the chemist who will say there‚Äôs a hold up because of the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù!! Or in layman‚Äôs terms come back in a few days when they are less busy!!
The app is brilliant in telling me when to take my medication, which there are quite a few off, & gives me plenty of notice when I am low.
So from me it‚Äôs a 10+ & long may it continue. 
Well done people."
4520322735,ggggggrrrrrreeeeet,3.18.2,5,Thank god for this app!,I wasted years in chemists.
4516762158,Not a happy bunny 2,3.18.2,1,Everything went wrong,The app gave me wrong info and I was told others were having same issue and an update was coming to fix it. The app allowed me to just keep on ordering even though I was waiting for the meds as had already ordered. One med was delivered and the app never changed to update that. After 20 days I chased and asked where the rest was. They said couldn‚Äôt get one but they just never told me. My exemption payment cert ran out as they didn‚Äôt keep me updated. After 22 days I gave up and cancelled and will now have to collect the medication from somewhere else. It‚Äôs a real shame as had high hopes. 5 to 10 days to get your meds clearly isn‚Äôt quite right and they don‚Äôt keep you informed about anything üòí
4514492962,CWD-London,3.18.2,5,A game changer - bye bye paper prescriptions,"Seriously impressed - that is the best user experience I've ever had. Taking an offline, overcomplicated, admin heavy process and turning it into a few button clicks on an app is very cool."

4480533162,mond0905,3.18.2,5,Much better than another online pharmacy I have used.,Been using Echo for a few months now and found the whole process of ordering medication easy and more importantly I get my medication on time with no issues. I had previously used another online pharmacy and Echo is so much better.
4474220091,Indieacer,3.18.2,2,"Brilliant app, rubbish pharmacy","Used to be great, but then they changed the pharmacy used to dispatch orders. Since then they‚Äôve failed to get meds to me on time twice. Switching provider."
4429531376,big bird 59,3.18.2,1,Waste of time,I signed up yesterday I‚Äôve had to put my exemption certificate in 4 times and each time I‚Äôm told I pressed the wrong button I checked every time even copied the wording on my card it‚Äôs the same so deleting the app
4416636698,A Digo,3.18.2,2,Nice app rubbish support,"After using this app for a while, I'm deleting my profile. My surgery is notorious for sending in paper prescriptions instead of electronic, echo are aware, I've written to the surgery and even spoken in person. Echo where always able to sort it out but not recently, just rubbish customer service.

It started out as my surgery (gp or nurse)need to talk to me they didn't, called and confirmed. Contacted echo and informed them to ask for an electronic one. one Aysha told me there's nothing they can do, even after asking how it was resolved previously. I was told to put in another request, which the app won't let me do as I have a pending request or or I have to pick it up. All Well and could if I could, but I can't pick up or request. 

Time to try the others, echo are no longer the lone players. Snooze you lose. Nobody has time for rubbish support for important things such as repeat medications."

So I‚Äôm not able to get out much and not having any family who lives by so I‚Äôve tried other apps like pharmacy2u but wasn‚Äôt very impressed so when I came across this app on on the apple store I thought why not give it a try 
I had one or two small problems at the beginning but nothing a quick email Couldn‚Äôt sort out and with in 48 hours my prescriptions arrived the only down side to all of this is your prescription is delivered by Royal Mail 
Not there own courier witch I find a little frustrating as it means waiting 2 days instead 1 day or a couple of hours 
( Hope Royal  Mail DON‚ÄôT  go on strike  ü§î )"

4339010830,Digoxin222,3.18.2,5,Just me,"Echo provide an excellent service. It took a little while to get used to using the App (old girl, me!). It‚Äôs been great to receive my meds in the post - no more queuing in the pharmacy. 

The Echo staff are very fast and responsive. I‚Äôm only leaving because I‚Äôve moved house and my new GP have offered their own delivery service. 
Thank you Echo!"
4314494156,Mitzi18011977,3.18.2,5,Brilliant,"Had my first order , soooooo much easier and hopefully I won‚Äôt forget to get my prescription renewed now !"
4313527797,TheNeonBible,3.18.2,5,A stress-free & wonderful service,"I have used ECHO for a couple of years (really should have written a review before now!) and it has changed my life! 
I used to spend literally HOURS queuing up at my local pharmacy, to no avail, as often my prescription hadn‚Äôt been sent through or it was part-missing etc.
 
Working full-time and also having a young family to care for after working hours did not allow me the time to ‚Äòwaste‚Äô pointlessly travelling to the pharmacy to wait, on average 40 minutes, to then be told I‚Äôd need to go back and collect the following day, once the prescription had been rectified. Life is too short to be so damn stressed out waiting for a bit of paper! 

Then my friend discovered the ECHO app (they‚Äôre type 1 diabetic), and it changed their life- literally! Orders were delivered directly to their place of work and an unnecessary stressful weight had be lifted; I soon followed their trend and my goodness, I would NEVER GO BACK TO USING MY PHARMACY AGAIN! Now, my orders are waiting on my doormat when I get home from a long day at work. Amazing!!!

I received notifications if there are any issues with prescriptions etc too and I really like having a reminder in the mornings too, (although sometimes the ‚Äúdays remaining‚Äù and notification of a request needs to be sent slightly sooner as sometimes GP pending request can take longer than 5 days so leaves me very close to not having enough to see me through before I receive my new order‚Äî issue here lies with GP being slow, but a few days extra for a request would be great!).

Overall, a brilliant APP and great and helpful team. I would (and have!) recommended to friends and family. 
Life changer- BRAVO! üëèüèº"
4308886432,ema_0611,3.18.2,5,Life changing,I‚Äôve been on a repeat prescription for about 5 years and have finally found an easier way of getting my meds every month - without pointless trips to the doctors or rearranging my life around pharmacy opening times. The delivery is free which is awesome! And most of the time it fits through my letterbox so I don‚Äôt even have to be home to receive it. Thank you for making my life so much easier. Keep being awesome!
4304909226,M3VCB,3.18.2,5,Excellent quality of service,Echo is a very easy App to use. Extremely helpful people who are ready to go above and beyond to help you. Can not fault Echo in anyway. Brilliant.
4303882118,GJaay,3.18.2,5,Fantastic!,"Have to say I was quite skeptical when I signed up but I‚Äôve been amazed by how brilliantly it works. I am on daily medication & will be for the rest of my life, echo has taken out the inconvenience of having to make regular trips to the pharmacy. Love it, great service!"
4296584011,üòáMissBx,3.18.2,5,Excellent service,I‚Äôm very pleased with Echo. For me it has been a lifesaver. I find it hard to get out the house to the Drs or chemist for my prescription. Thank you

4262743400,Kingersss,3.18.2,5,Easy peasy,This app is easy to use. The service it provides has proven to be a quick and efficient way to get meds with the minimum of hassle.
4259024522,Poor Service üòì,3.18.2,1,Poor service,"On three occasions over the last 6 months I‚Äôve had to chase my medication, each time with a similar excuse! 

This time my surgery / dispensary hadn‚Äôt authorized my medication. I contacted the dispensary the request had not been received! 

A service of this type should take away the stress of ordering your medication not create anxiety that the delivery will be missed! 

Account deleted!"
4236737282,Lesleyrachey,3.18.2,5,So helpful,"I have been using this service around a year now and I can honestly say it‚Äôs the best thing I‚Äôve ever done. No more going to the local pharmacy who always seem to have run out of one item or another and can I go back the next day. There is always someone you can chat to about any concerns you may have, and you can even set up reminders every day as to what tablets to take ( excellent if you are forgetful ) can‚Äôt recommend highly enough"
4234251098,Musicgeek567,3.18.2,2,Went months without getting my tablets on time,"The app was great, but then orders stopped working and would run out of tablets and the customer service would just blame it on my doctors. When it often was their own fault. Had to stop using app as every month the tablets would be late"
4225926725,Bolfty,3.18.2,5,The best app,Having tried several company‚Äôs offering to get your perscription and send it to you they failed I was constantly phoning and chasing my order having to phone doctors and the companys too. ECHO is outstanding you get the app fill in the form then when your medications is approved you just request  when you are getting near the end of your medication they are very efficient and never had a problem at all well done Echo
4164943814,Dr Falken,3.18.2,5,Brilliant app - easy to use and great customer service,"Have been using this app for several months now. I have a repeat prescription but find it hard to get to a pharmacy due to work commitments. However, it‚Äôs a doddle with Echo. Get reminded, place the request, pay through the app and boom! It arrives through the door. (Not with a real explosion - that was for effect!)

Had a hiccup recently, though. Another healthcare app that manages my company medical insurance usurped Echo as my pharmacy of choice declared to my GP surgery. When I tried to order with Echo, the process stalled but Echo kept emailing me to keep me updated. When it came to action required from me, I dealt with Echo customer services and after a couple of promptly answered emails, Echo had sorted out the issue and the app notified me that my prescription was ready for payment. All fixed - great customer support.

There are similar apps out there for this function (and some will change your preferred pharmacy for you, it turns out), but I can‚Äôt fault Echo. If any part could be improved, I would like to see a ‚Äòrequest and authorise payment‚Äô option (rather than it being 2 separate operations separated by a nominal day or two), which preauthorises the payment on the condition that the GP approves the prescription. The next event would then be the prescription coming through the letterbox instead of a second visit to the app to pay once the GP has approved the request."
4094497800,Temperate,3.18.2,5,Very impressed,"Love this app.  Just completed my first order. Worked like a dream and my medication arrived earlier than stated given it was my first order.  I really like the daily reminder on my iPad to take my medication too and so much less hassle than going to the pharmacy to pick up the prescriptions. Tablets were shipped in a sturdy cardboard sleeve that was able to fit through the letterbox, so didn‚Äôt even need to be here to receive the Royal Mail 48hr package."
4057500334,Krysuk,3.18.2,3,Not smooth sailing - though they have tried to help make things better,"Had a lot of issues when I first started using this app and found myself without medication a few times because it wasn‚Äôt smooth sailing 
The service is more stable now, but often have to contact my doctor to make sure that they respond to the echo requests
An improvement for now, but hoping the service will continue to improve"

4025282363,Bmunch100,3.18.2,4,Great app,"Great service and much more convenient than going to a pharmacy. Why didn‚Äôt someone think of this sooner! Only issue is that it is constantly flagging to re-order when I don‚Äôt need to which is a bit annoying, but very minor."
4025213501,KathyB14,3.18.2,5,Excellent! Perfect service,"I have been using Echo for over a year now and it has been a perfect experience for me.  Reminders and meds always delivered before I run out. Like many others, my gp surgery is under so much pressure these days it was becoming more of a hassle to get repeats in time, particularly as I travel a lot for work.  
This service is fast and efficient - helpful if you have any questions and communication is great. All packages are small enough to fit through the letter box so you don‚Äôt have to be home for delivery. 
It has taken all the  stress away when it comes to making sure I have my essentials. 
I am sure too that it if more people use it, it will free up more time for GPS to see more patients - it‚Äôs a win win!  Great job Echo!"
4024918736,Lilacnala,3.18.2,5,A life changer!,Having a full time job can mean I rarely get to the chemist to pick up my prescriptions so echo delivering them to my door is super helpful! Also I receive a notification when I have 10 or so tablets left so I can order a repeat before I run out. Honestly the best app ever!
4024889135,saralukies,3.18.2,5,Great little app,Does exactly what it says on the tin
4024884118,Supersonicmoh,3.18.2,2,Echo,"Having used the app for almost 6 months. I find it really easy to use. It's just a matter of ordering via the Echo App and the medication turns up on your doorstep. However, lately I have experienced delays in receiving my medication on time. I am not sure if this due to my GP or the app. However, I would appreciate if better turn around times could be available. 9 days and still waiting for medications... Now have run out..

3993969334,Henderson86,3.18.2,5,So far so good,1st time using and very easy to order medication. Ordered on Monday and is dispatched in post by Wednesday.
3964417674,Andyg2,3.18.2,5,Perfect!,Had this app for some time now and was dubious as to how it would work but I have to compliment them in that I have never had an issue with ordering or delivery and any questions are answered in a speedy fashion. Highly recommend!
3948046290,Flyer-Adam,3.18.2,1,Not all medications available,"The service will not deliver controlled drugs.

Helpfully you only find this out once you‚Äôve registered and the app has sent its details to your GP surgery already.

Even the FAQs in the app don‚Äôt mention this. They just talk about the process for electronic/paper prescriptions relating to controlled drugs - odd if the service won‚Äôt deliver them."
3937870348,Wilesy64,3.18.2,5,"Brilliant app, Brilliant service","The app is so easy to set up and use and is a life saver for those who are either unable to collect or have timing issues with the GP surgery and working hours. 
Prompt emails send reminding me when the prescription is due to be renewed and with a press of a button for each medication, delivery is within a week.
I love it."
3936682049,meganmegan13,3.18.2,2,Crucial lack of communication for daily medication,"When ordering medication that you take daily is it not necessary to be notified when there is a delay in the shipment to you? Or if you are having to order elsewhere and may take longer? The first time I used the service it was flawless and I even recommended it to my doctors so she could tell more people. HOWEVER, the last 2 times when placing an order they have failed to tell me that it is out of stock and that they are waiting a restock.. the date of which they have no idea. My first delayed order was still saying ‚Äòprocessing‚Äô after 9 days of ordering!! Both times I have had to contact customer services and ask what is happening to my order to be told they don‚Äôt have an expected date of arrival to which then I have to cancel my order await refund and reorder with my chemist. The whole point of this repeat prescription service is for people who are repeatedly taking medication. This is crucial information that NEEDS to be supplied and the lack of makes the app and the whole concept behind it completely and utterly useless."
3933836674,Red Ron70,3.18.2,5,Review,Very happy with echo they are always happy to help you if needed I‚Äôve never had to wait long for my prescriptions and they always keep me informed of what‚Äôs going on.

Not fit for people who are reliant on repeat prescriptions. Use Pharmacy2u or ask your GP for their recommended service."
3929848676,Rae sc,3.18.2,1,Too many problems,"I had high hopes for this app but have generally found the whole process very slow and had to prompt them to send requests to the GP.  I have also been sent medication in packages too large for any post box, which they promise they don‚Äôt do.  If you have to collect from the depot then I would collect it from the chemist myself.  Also had medication out of stock which they haven‚Äôt then ordered in without me requesting this.  I will not be using them again."

I contacted Echo and was told they could not find my NHS record. All details I had supplied were correct. 1 star review because 1. No warning online that initial requests may take longer than 2 weeks to fulfil. 2. Frankly irresponsible of Echo to leave it knowing my medication would run out in 2 weeks without letting me know what was happening. I only found out when I asked. Consequently I cancelled the request as they could not be fulfilled in time and I will now cancel my account."

3829409816,SEOKJINHIE,3.18.1,5,So good for people who are too busy to make appointments,"I go to University and work so it‚Äôs very hard for me to make appointments with my GP and know whether or not I‚Äôll actually be able to attend them, and for simple prescription updates, it‚Äôs not very efficient for me to have to spend 20+ minutes waiting for a piece of paper. This app takes all of that away - so long as you have had to prescription given to you already. I love the convenience and that there‚Äôs no delivery fee!

The only thing I do wish, however, was that there was a way to leave a note or something for my GP just in case I need to request a higher dose or something like that, but I do suppose there could be a lot of problems arising with this idea."

I will continue to use echo for as long as its around :) I love that it tells you when to take your medication.

Living in a rural location where our local surgery has recently closed I thought this was the answer. How wrong I was! I always order my prescription in plenty of time, but Echo failed to request it from my GP resulting in me having to chase it up. When it was eventually processed I was told it had been dispatched only to receive another email a day later to say one of my vital meds was out of stock. What did Echo do? Cancel the whole order???? This is despite me asking them not to! Suffice to say I will not be using them again. Faceless company, appalling customer service who tell you blatant lies via the customer chat."

3766124444,Pink nannie,3.18.1,5,Echo,Great fast no waiting in the chemist service . It‚Äôs the way forward only gripe is on a repeat prescription it always told you when your blood tests were due and with this service there is no advise maybe this could be included on here too?
3743128945,Bong face killa,3.18.0,5,Great app!!,"This app is an absolute god send! 

I suffer with mental health problems and am on four repeat prescriptions on a long term basis. Before I stumbled across this app it was REALLY hard to remember to get repeat scripts and I found it extremely difficult as my dr surgery is in a different town and i do not drive so had to get the bus. Part of my MH conditions is that I find it very hard if not impossible to talk to people on the phone. This app completely bypasses that whole difficulty. This app saves me literally days worth of hours!

I am also on long term sick benefits and was SO impressed that all I had to do was take a picture of my benefits entitlement letter, click send through the app and within a couple of hours I was all set to continue receiving my free NHS prescriptions via this service. 

As I said earlier, an absolute life saver for me. I couldn‚Äôt recommend this service enough. It makes me want to shout from the rooftops. I could see it being particularly useful for people that have communication problems, like myself, or elderly people that cannot physically manage to get themselves to the dr. 

Thank you sincerely, kind people at echo!"

3623007020,Billpix,3.18.0,3,Restricting,"I have been using the echo service for some 18 months. The supply and refill aspect of the service is excellent, and I always get my meds on time. However, I rely upon a different app to keep a check on how many tablets I have left. Unless I am missing something, there is no way that I can correct tablet numbers without contacting the supplier. This can be inconvenient, and I would prefer to have the ability to change figures when I stock check."
3619850068,iambruceadams,3.18.0,5,Never üëèüèª fails üëèüèª,"This app is life changing, in an actual way rather than the hyperbolic way that phrase usually gets used.

On the rare occasion that something goes wrong ‚Äì very occasionally on their end, but far more often to do with inefficiency elsewhere in the chain or my own omission ‚Äì their response has never failed to exceed my expectations. As a result of their interventions, I have never been without medication in the 2 years I have been using it.

The best thing about Echo is that it‚Äôs one part of the chain between my GP and the medication being in my hands where I can always rely on being able to talk (instantly) to an empathetic human. Repeat medication can be complicated enough as it is. Echo makes it simple."
3616809854,C√°ilin,3.17.1,5,Love this App,Echo are so quick at sending out repeat prescriptions and they keep you updated along the way.

3611780917,Arcoiris2012,3.18.0,5,Fantastic Service,"I can't recommend this app and service enough. Everyone who has repeat medication should use Echo.

Communication via the online support is fast and personal.
This is the future of repeat medication ordering.

I can't wait until it's available for under 18s also as it will make it much easier to coordinate meds for our little one.

I have one suggestion which is to be able Pre-add all meds prior to ordering as at the moment you can only add those that a required right now. It would be good to add all meds and tick those you required at that time. I recommended this app to friend yesterday and helped her to create an account. Unfortunately she wasn't ready to order any meds so I couldn't help her add her current medication. 

This is a very small issue but doesn't affect my recommendation in any way."

It was so much trouble before when I had to order a repeat prescription from the doctors and half the time when I went to pick it up they couldn‚Äôt find it or it wasn‚Äôt ready. 
I would go to the chemist which is very handy right next door to the doctors. The only trouble is the chemist is always busy and you can wait sometimes half an hour among people with illnesses coughing and spreading germs.
I would definitely recommend Echo."

3611769804,Rubybloo,3.17.1,5,"Great app, not so great updates","Whilst the service that this app provides is brilliant, there are problems with the app when it is updated. Sometimes features disappear and this can be frustrating. For example if you want to change the times of pill reminders you are unable to. Another example was when I needed to change the remaining number of pills as it was out of synch with the actual number of pills I had left. I asked the help team who informed me that they wouldn‚Äôt be able to do it for me as they were unable to do this at present and would hopefully be able to do it in the New Year! Aside from these grumbles, the service provided is very good and it is clear of the progress of your order. Just fix the bugs and it would be 5 stars from me!"

3611622809,Kimbly1891,3.17.1,4,Easy to use.,"Very easy app to use and very helpful if you have multiple repeat prescriptions. I very much like the fact you can use ApplePay to pay for the prescriptions for the quickness of it.

3611622392,S4banna,3.17.1,5,Amazing needs a couple of tweaks,"After the government stopped automatic renewals I kept running out of my meds.  No matter how many reminders I set myself to call the doc and get a renewal it never happened in time. This is so easy, it reminds you, sends off the renewal and the
Meds arrive through your door. 

The only issue is when you put in an early request, like over Christmas when doctors will allow an early request, the original date remains and you have to submit a request you know will be refused. Other than that it‚Äôs an amazing app and I wouldn‚Äôt be without it."
3611614536,Deriside,3.17.1,1,Was fantastic now a pain!,When I first got the app it was amazing and I had my first two deliveries fine.  Unfortunately then it went wrong.  It emailed me saying that my doctor would not approve my prescription even though I had received it.  Now it tells me I need to order more even though I don‚Äôt.  I called them and was told it would be sorted before the end of the year but it‚Äôs not.  Now it is just confusing and annoying.  I think I‚Äôm going to go back to my local pharmacy as this never happened with them.

Notifications through the app to remind you when to take your medication for that. 

And finally a brilliant team behind the scenes. Who are more than happy to help with any issues you have  and are easily contactable via the In app support feature. Or to send you cute little notes in your packages ;)"

Also think it would be good to contact surgery‚Äôs proactively where your customers are based if you haven‚Äôt got this in place already and give them a good background on what you are doing and what you are delivering for patients. I did sit with my GP and show her the app and how it works Ect and she was impressed however there are competitors and you want to stand out from the crowd, relationship management is really key to this. Happy to feedback further if it helps. I work for NHS myself and I am overall really impressed with this service, if an appointment can cost anywhere between ¬£30-¬£85 with a patient and you‚Äôre helping patients by pass this by keeping them up to date with when their reviews actually are ect then what can go wrong."

3556362138,Frankiebabe55,3.17.1,5,Fantastic app and great timesaver,"What a brilliant App all my medication ordered at the touch of a button and delivered on time ,saves me a trip to the doctors to order my repeat prescriptions."
3556100142,rimibar,3.17.1,5,"Efficient, accurate, great service...","And yes, I am referring to a repeat prescription service. Can't recommend enough. Well done guys - every update a step forward. Keep it up!"
3555991743,ShaneLiam0621,3.17.1,5,Great service,I see this service on Facebook and I downloaded app to try it for my partner so he can receive all his medication easier as he was finding it very difficult to collect it from doctors surgery and I tried it online very easy to do and they email you to say it‚Äôs been completed and is sent out in the post and they send you repeat prescription reminders so you apply next month on time great service.
3555898573,EchoNoMeds,3.17.1,1,Think before you download this pile of ...,"Ok. So I‚Äôm diabetic and have a heart problem. I have 6 different medicines that need ordering at various times of the month. I also work away so not at home during the week.
So going electronic and have them delivered to my house where my partner can receive them and keep them for me until I return seems, on paper at least, a good idea. 
Well, so how difficult can one app make things?
It‚Äôs now over a week since I signed up to Echo, I ordered my tablets and the app tells me that they‚Äôve contacted my surgery and awaiting authorisation from my doctor. 5 days go by, still no delivery, then I get an email saying there‚Äôs been an issue and they cannot fulfil my order. 
So I cancel my account with Echo and order through the surgery website as usual for collection at my nominated pharmacy. So now, I‚Äôm at my nominated pharmacy and they tell me they have no prescription for me. I phone the surgery and they tell me my order is with Echo. My surgery tell me that they cannot order any further drugs as there‚Äôs an order on the system with Echo and that I need to collect from Echo. 
This has to be one of the most frustrating experiences in years.
So, please think twice before you place your faith in this service, of it isn‚Äôt broken don‚Äôt try to fix it. 
I‚Äôm now off to my pharmacy (third time) with an emergency dispensing code to get my overdue prescription... fingers crossed, if you hear someone shouting it‚Äôs probably due to the Echo..."

3545545957,Macca8888,3.17.1,1,Very poor. Don‚Äôt bother,"I have never had such poor service in my life. 
Don‚Äôt use. They hold onto your prescriptions without correspondence when they can not supply your medication."
3537302531,G_a_i_l,3.17.1,4,Easy to use but some glitches,"I much prefer using Echo for medicines rather than having to go and wait at a pharmacy,  it is very easy to use and brilliant to get the medications delivered. However there are a few glitches, it can remind you to order your next batch of medications immediately after receiving a new batch of medication - therefore too soon which would cause stockpiling. Also one of my medications once in the delivery box from Echo does not fit through my letter box and I have to go to the post office sorting office each time thereby defeating the usefulness of having medications delivered to me. I will continue to use Echo though, it is easy to use and prferred to old method."
3530502826,simonp820,3.17.1,1,Difficult to use all - poor support,"Like others have said, it‚Äôs excruciatingly difficult to get setup and customer support is dreadful. Uninstalled."
3522234805,Bandarid,3.17.1,3,History of orders,It seems that the history of previous orders is not showing in the app properly. Please amend so it can.
3514457983,crunchie93,3.17.1,4,Great service,Great service however the reminder to order part is completely out of sync  - getting reminders just days after ordering
3503125643,Worldwidemark,3.17.1,1,Rubbish,They screwed up my first order so I was hopeful that by now I placed my second order they would‚Äôve learnt the lessons‚Ä¶ How wrong was I! The second order has still not showing off and they just keep making up excuses I asked them to send me all the correspondence they had with my GP and they haven‚Äôt done that I don‚Äôt believe they‚Äôve done anything to action my order. Useless
3493961715,Doobie 999,3.17.1,5,Very good,"Started on new medication that will be with me for a while. The setup was very easy, scanned my tablets to ensure dosage and manufacturer was captured. Going into the app reminds me that I am running low, so request GP approval which is taken care of, once this is confirmed the app will ask me to pay for the medication, standard cost, tablets arrived in a few days. I would like the app to remind me that I am running low without having to access the app, the same with when the approval from the GP arrives as then need to make payment. Once these few things are sorted then I can‚Äôt find any fault, very good and easy."
3493070252,Squeakychamster,3.17.1,1,Do not use!!!!,"Please do not use Echo. I requested my asthma medication 10 days before running out. They said they‚Äôd sent the request to my GP but I didn‚Äôt receive I notification that the prescription had been sent through to Echo. I emailed Echo and asked them to follow up with the GP. They told me to! Some service! I followed up with my GP and they said they had received no repeat prescription requests. Great. My GP kindly agreed to send the prescription through ASAP. I asked Echo to look into why this happened but not only could they not work out why but they also did not apologise. I told them I needed the medication urgently but they refused to send it next day delivery. I just can‚Äôt believe they didn‚Äôt even say sorry. Honestly, do not use this service. It is not worth the stress."
