Well, so how difficult can one app make things?
It’s now over a week since I signed up to Echo, I ordered my tablets and the app tells me that they’ve contacted my surgery and awaiting authorisation from my doctor. 5 days go by, still no delivery, then I get an email saying there’s been an issue and they cannot fulfil my order. 
So I cancel my account with Echo and order through the surgery website as usual for collection at my nominated pharmacy. So now, I’m at my nominated pharmacy and they tell me they have no prescription for me. I phone the surgery and they tell me my order is with Echo. My surgery tell me that they cannot order any further drugs as there’s an order on the system with Echo and that I need to collect from Echo. 
This has to be one of the most frustrating experiences in years.

Had to arrange an emergency prescription (in tears) through my surgery directly. They've never heard of this company and have advised me not to use Echo again. Ironically, without my medication I'm at high risk of a heart attack: take away the medication and add the stress of trying to obtain the medication via Echo = a life-threatening situation.

consent. This is ridiculous. There is no way to cancel this request in the

My doctor’s surgery said it’s not possible for me to use both echo for my monthly meds and use a local pharmacy for emergency antibiotics- I have to choose, one or the other.

So alas I will have to cancel my account with echo in case I ever need an emergency prescription again (it took me a couple of hours of phone calls and waiting in my local pharmacy to resolve).

says order now) Also my biggest problem is that I made the mistake of using 
this for my adhd meds, it caused a 4 week delay (due to a number of issues)

work for some, might not for others, try it and decide for yourself.",0,1,0,1,0,0,3,2.17.0,google
